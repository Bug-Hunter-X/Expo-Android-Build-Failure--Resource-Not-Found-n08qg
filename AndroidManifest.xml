This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message similar to: `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.ProcessResourceAction > com.android.ide.common.internal.LoggedErrorException: Failed to run command: /usr/bin/aapt2 ...  ...  Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: resource not found: ...`  The error message indicates that a required resource cannot be found during the build process, but the resource is actually present in the project.  This is usually caused by inconsistencies between the AndroidManifest.xml file, build.gradle files, and the project's resource files.  Incorrectly configured build variants, missing dependencies, or incorrect resource paths can lead to this error.
