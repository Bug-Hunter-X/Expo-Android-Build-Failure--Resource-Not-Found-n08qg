The solution involves carefully reviewing the project's configuration files and resources. One common cause is inconsistencies between build variants. Ensure that the build variants in your `build.gradle` files are correctly configured and match the resources you are using. For example, ensure the correct `res` directory is being used for each variant.  Double-check that all required resources are properly declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Clean and rebuild your project; this often resolves temporary inconsistencies.  If the problem persists, carefully compare the error message's resource path with the actual location of the resource in your project to pinpoint the discrepancy.  This repo's solution focuses on a scenario where the problem is tied to mismatch in the build variants and resolves the issue by ensuring that the resources are correctly linked.
